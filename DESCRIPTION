Description: Tools developed to facilitate the establishment of the rank and social hierarchy 
             for gregarious animals by the Si method developed by 
             Kondo & Hurnik (1990)<doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-1591(90)90125-W>. It is
             also possible to determine the number of agonistic interactions between two
